The drinks data set contains information on the total servings of different alcohols and the total liters of pure alcohol consumed by different countries. All of these are numeric variables and are presented as ‘beer_servings’ for the average number of beer servings per person in each country, ‘wine_servings’ for the average number of wine servings per person in each country, ‘spirit_servings’ for the average number of spirit servings per person in each country, ‘total_liters_of_pure_alcohol’ for the average total liters of pure alcohol per person in each country .</description>
